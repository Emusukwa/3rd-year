==trunks==(3 trunks superior ,middle and inferior)-(located  in the neck and on the first rib)
cranial nerve 5 and 6 combine to form superior trunk
cranial nerve 7 forms the meddle trunk
 cranial nerve 8 and thoracic nerve one form the inferior trunk
 ![[Pasted image 20240522044720.png]]

==division==(we have anterior(3) and posterior(3) divisions (6 divisions))-(located between the clavicle(they lie posterior to the clavicle) and  the first rib)

superior trunk gives off the anterior and posterior branch-(a then p)
middle  trunk gives off anterior and posterior branch(a then p)
inferior  trunk gives off the posterior and anterior branch(p and a)



==cords(3)==-armpits or axilla ,named based on their position relative to the axillary artery: lateral, posterior, and medial cords


we have three cords lateral, medial and posterior
 lateral form my the union of the two anterior cords(from the superior and middle trunk)
 medial trunk from the form from the anterior division of the inferior trunk
 we have the posterior cord from by the union  of the three posterior trunks

==terminal branches  then nerves== ( hint they form letter m)

lateral cord gives out the lateral branch and medial branch(l then m)

posterior cord gives off the lateral and medial branch(l then m)

medial gives off lateral and medial branch(l then m)

note the branches form the letter m Terminal branches include musculocutaneous, median, ulnar, axillary, and radial nerves, extending into the arm and forearm.


 posterior cord form the  ==radial nerve==
 posterior cord form ==axillary nerve==

 ==ulna nerve== from the medial cord
  ==musculocutaneous nerve== from the lateral cord

mnemonics
rudby teem dont cover bruises


rugby
long(lateral pectoral nerve)
leg(lateral root of the medial nerve)
men(musculocutaneous nerve)

branches of the medial cord
rugby players  make many moves using muscles

branches of the posterior cord
ultra competitive


 ==median nerve== is formed from the union of the lateral cord and medial cord
median nerve leaves the forearm and enters the palm
by passing through the carpel tunnel deep to the flexor retinaculum

in the arm it branches gives off anterior interosseous nerve  which innervate muscles of the deep layer and the palmar branch
